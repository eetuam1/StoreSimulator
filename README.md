# StoreSimulator
### Project Overview
StoreSimulator is a simulation tool designed to model customer flows and manage queues across various service points, such as customer service counters and checkout lines. The goal of this project is to realistically simulate customer behavior, providing insights into optimizing service points and enhancing queue management. The simulator also features visualizations to help monitor customer experiences intuitively.

### Features
<p> - Simulates customer arrivals and interactions with service points</p>
<p> - Visualizes customer flows and queue lengths in real-time</p>
<p> - Implements customizable customer arrival patterns and service point behaviors</p>
<p> - Offers a modular MVC architecture for easy extensibility</p>
<p> - Collects data for performance analysis and optimization</p>
<p> - Fully functional backend for data storage and retrieval</p>

### Tech Stack
This project uses:
<p> - JavaFX for the graphical user interface</p>
<p> - Java as the primary programming language</p>
<p> - MariaDB for data storage and retrieval</p>
<p> - JUnit for testing</p>
